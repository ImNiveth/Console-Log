    <p id="p1">Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.[9] Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.</p>

        <p id="p1">Visual Studio Code was first announced on April 29, 2015, by Microsoft at the 2015 Build conference. A preview build was released shortly thereafter.[10]</p>
        
        <p id="p1">On November 18, 2015, the source of Visual Studio Code was released under the MIT License, and made available on GitHub. Extension support was also announced.[11] On April 14, 2016, Visual Studio Code graduated from the public preview stage and was released to the Web.[12] Microsoft has released most of Visual Studio Code's source code on GitHub under the permissive MIT License,[5][13] while the releases by Microsoft are proprietary freeware.[7]</p>

        <p id="p1">Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Go, Node.js, Python and C++.[15][16][17][18] It is based on the Electron framework,[19] which is used to develop Node.js Web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called Visual Studio Online and Visual Studio Team Services).[20]</p>
